# Operanting System Simulator

This project implements in Clojure a simplified simulator of an operating system. It basically simulates all the states in which a job in the operating system goes through its life cycle.

## Usage

This project uses [leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) to build and run itself. If you already have it, just apply the following command to the project root.

```
lein run
```
